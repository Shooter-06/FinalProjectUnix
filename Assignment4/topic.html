        <p id="p1">The sport of soccer (called football in most of the world) is considered to be the world's most popular sport. In soccer there are two teams of eleven players. Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal.</p>
        <p id="p2">Soccer is a team sport played by a team of 11 players against another team of 11 players on a field.The team has one designated goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. Outfield players are usually specialised in attacking or defending or both. A team is typically split into defenders, midfielders and forwards, though there is no restriction on players moving anywhere on the pitch. It is known as soccer in North America, but is called football in most of the rest of the world. Its full name is Association Football.</p>
        <p id="p3">No one knows exactly when soccer was created, but the earliest versions of the game can be traced back 3,000 years.</p>
