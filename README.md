PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
	
This project was created based on the discussion of me and my teammates about what GNU/Linux scenario that we want to develop which consists of creating a create VPS streaming video server. Using some samples and examples we got form different open sources, a video streaming server. We intend to create more like a web server with RTMP capability built into it that is dedicated to delivering live or on demand video content to the users with computer, smart tv or mobile device.


Timeline: 

The timeline for our project is intended to be completed in less than 3 weeks. So, we will have three different deliverable parts and each one will involve in improving the previous deliverables:

1.Project description/goals and deliverables:
	Deliveries: part1

The first part involves of brainstorming what we will build in our project that is to buy a VPS and then create a server that will work by combining /breaking down different data packets so that both video and audio will be able to work simultaneously without any compilation errors. It is hard because some are managed-VPS which only allow users to have access only on the control panels. In that case, we need to find a free non-managed VPS that will allow us to add anything like games, video streaming server and other features. One of the servers we discussed before was Scalahosting and we had a lot of issues, but now we decided to use OVHcloud based on the teacherâ€™s suggestion and add a game to try it out. Even though we don't have a lot knowledge and experience creating servers, we intend to learn and do researches about how to build a server that will be able to store, display videos. 

	Deliveries: part2
we intend to build the VPS in the OVHcloud. We added a game to test if our server is working and we used the SSH key to connect it to the out VM machine and run the game. The brainstorming part was since it was our first time creating a server like that, a video server is hard for us and we were trying using Ip-address and the name of server to connect it the VM. We changed the admin password when we logged in and added the users for all of us and used the sudo group codes to add the game. The game was tricky because we had to update the all the packages from the game because we needed to see other new packages to install.  

	Deliveries: part3
Requirements: Our work is divided into three parts where one created the VPS, GitHub and added the items on the server like a game, video streaming and etc. We will try to add all the things like creating multiple user accounts, service management, system security, and the automated tasks using a script language and others that will be relevant in making our server more needs secure and reliable. By our last delivery, we hope to build the streaming server that shows the pre-recorder video or if we can, we aim at creating a game server that contains game that you can play. 



Major technical issues solutions compared:
 
For now, we are aiming on creating and developing a Debian server installation with the SSH-web server but in case we wanted to change in the future, I would suggest to my teammates that we try building the raspberry pi project to learn some new features. While developing the SSH-web server with Debian, we will try to create a video streaming server or a gaming center and see what that way will take us. So, we still have a lot of doubts on what server exactly to create but for we agreed now is starting with the SSH-web server and later create the video-streaming server inside our Linux VM. So, for now, we will aim on comparing different web servers with ours so that we can develop a perfect working and excellent server that can be developed into an advance server in the future.
