# FinalProjectUnix
## Part I: Final project proposal
Through the discussion of me and my teammates about what GNU/Linux scenario should we
develop for the final project, we decided ended up choosing to create a video streaming server with
Linux. Using some samples and examples we got form different open sources, a video streaming
server is a web server with RTMP capability built into it that is dedicated to delivering live or ondemand video content to the user’s computer, smart tv or mobile device.

(https://corp.kaltura.com/blog/video-streaming-server/). 

 One of the references we used to describe and define well what web server we intend
to build.
## 1. Project description/goals: 
The main goal is that our team wants to build that will work by
combining/breaking down different data packets so that both video and audio will be able to work
simultaneously on the any user’s device without an errors and complication. Even tho it might seem
a little bit hard due we don’t have a lot of explaining in creating servers and working with outsides or
new configuration, we plan on building creating a server that will be able to store, display and take in
a video. Based on some description that we saw on the internet about what a server could look like,
we used an idea of developing in the future a specific technology to full length store videos clips,
and they can be distributed/ shared anytime needed. We don’t know yet if we will be able to use
some transcoding tools that will boast the quality features to ensure high-quality streaming but, if
needed and we are not able to use them, we aim on asking the help to our teacher for better
clarification in moving on with our project.
## 2. Platform of choice:
For the devices that we will use in creating and developing our project consist of a desktop. We will
simply use a VM facilitate demonstration of our project. In case we find out later that building is not
easily done on a VM or depending on the installation in our pc, we cannot support a having extra
space on our VM, we expect to clarify our issues and problems to the teacher so that we can discuss
together and come up with a better solution. Like I said, it will be our first time building a server, we
will have a lot of issues, complication but we aim on working to get to build a perfect, working,
and better server.
## 3. Requirements:
Our team of three people is going to be divided so everyone in the group has something to do. I know it's gonna be difficult to include everything you asked for, but we will do our best in including everything. I tink that the creation of multiple user accounts, service management, system security, and the automated tasks using a script language are really relevant for our project because those are what a server needs to be secure and reliable. we are going to do our best in our project because we don't have that much left, but we'll see.The requirements needed of building any server project are materials like having a computer that is in better conditions(working and has free enough space and memory) , a good architecture(what sort of computer uses -i386, PowerPC, etc. it is necessary to have the rights parts of your computer like having chips on which Debian can run. We aim on using Debian in case my colleagues later find a new distribution to explore.), having enough memory helps to because we might later need to install some extensions to help our server to run. With memory, we also need storage(the hard-drive is the heart of the server because even if you
lost everything with a working hard-drive, you could retrieve your information.) Cooling is another
feature that will help our server to not overheat. Network, monitor and keyboard, power, etc… , are
other features that will contribute to running our server. So, with these elements working perfectly, we
will be able to develop a working project. One thing we thought about, but we will not use is
developing a Raspberry pi project. To my perspective, it looked like the most fun and interesting than
other options, but I had to go with of my friends to accomplish the same goal for our final project.
## 4. Major technical issues solutions compared:
For now, we are aiming on creating and developing a Debian server installation with the SSH-web
server but in case we wanted to change in the future, I would suggest to my teammates that we try
building the raspberry pi project to learn some new features. While developing the SSH-web server
with Debian, we will try to create a video streaming server and see what that way will take us. So, we
still have a lot of doubts on what server exactly to create but for we agreed now is starting with the
SSH-web server and later create the video-streaming server inside our Linux VM. So, for now, we
will aim on comparing different web servers with ours so that we can develop a perfect working and
excellent server that can be developed into an advance server in the future.
## 5. Timeline:
The timeline for our project will be completed in less than 3weeks. So, we hope to be able to build a
complete server in less than 3 weeks. We will put in efforts as we can so that we don’t deliver
uncompleted work and we will be on time.
## 6. Team composition:
This project will be completed by three team members:
 Yassine El Yamani
 Fiacre Byiringiro
 Ivan Tewolde
## 2-scenarios:
For our first scenario, we thought about building a server from scratch, like developing our own
server without starting without using any outside codes or help from previous servers. Like we
explained above, it will be challenging but it will help us to learn more about what we are capable of
and what our limits might be. The second scenario was more complex. It involved understanding
someone’ sever and complete it ore develop it by adding the requirement of the project. The reason
that we choose not to do it is it takes so much time to understand someone’s prescription on different
things and at some point, we might not respect his rights to privacy, and we will constantly need his
approval to move one with each step. We thought about the problems we might encounter with his/her
license issues, so , we decided to work with the option one. Another example of a project or extra
features we might add on our sites are editing out video storage resource that in our server we might
even be able to store these videos and with a good quality standard.
